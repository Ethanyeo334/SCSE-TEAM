	<u>The reason I like programming as a whole and why I chose this line of work for my future:</u>
	<p>I enjoy the problem solving aspect of prgramming; finding solutions and discussing it with others is truly an irreplacable feeling. I thoroughly enjoy how the challenges are difficult yet taloured to our abilities as beginners.</p>
	<p>Given how much I enjoy this type of environment, I seek to find a job that provides me the opportunity to both have a secluded and condusive work environment and a chance to interact with like-minded individuals.</p>
	<p>There have been some games that inspire me and in a way encouraged me to pursue a career in making games by making use of their interactive medium to immerse the player in the world or to challenge the assumptions we make in our lives about games as a whole. Below is a screenshot of the game Undertale made by a single person:</p>

	<u>How being in this course will help me achieve my goals for the future:</u>
	<p>Through this course and the experiences I will gain here in NYP, I think that I will be adequately prepared to get me started working in a job.</p>
	<p>Additionally, i will gain not only the technical skills needed to get a job, but also the ability to learn and adapt quickly to assignments and the people around me.</p>
	<p>Learning about the different facets of game development and the process of developing a game will give me a better understanding of the industry outside.</p>
