	<p>In primary school, I was regarded as an outgoing and helpful student, offering to help and take part in activities that would have helped improve the lives of those around me.</p>
	<p>For my PSLE, I managed to get a score of 206 which was a pretty big improvement from 186 during prelim exams.</p>
	<p>In addition, I was a part of two CCAs; Handbells and Cub Scouts. Since there were two CCA days a week, I would go for one CCA on each day. Despite my attendance, I was still given leadership positions in both CCAs because of my enthusiasm and commitment.</p>

	<p>In secondary school, I became a more reserved person with a smaller clique despite having considerable reach in my network of friends.</p>
	<p>From secondary 3 onwards, I had also managed to climb to the top 20% of my cohort in academics. I achieved a raw score of 12 for my L1R4 during 'o' levels.</p>
	<p>For my CCA, I was a part of the school's symphonic band where in secondary 3, I became the president.</p>
	<p>As president of the band, I was basically responsible for everything regarding band ranging from communication with conductors and teachers to welfare of all band members.</p>
